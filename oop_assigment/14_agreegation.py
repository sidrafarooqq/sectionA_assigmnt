# 14. Aggregation
# Assignment:
# Create a class Department and a class Employee. Use aggregation by having a Department object store a reference to an Employee object that exists independently of it.

        self.emp_id = emp_id
        self.name = name

        return f"Employee ID: {self.emp_id}, Name: {self.name}"

        self.dept_name = dept_name
