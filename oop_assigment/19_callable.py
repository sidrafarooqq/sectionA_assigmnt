# 19. callable() and __call__()
# Assignment:
# Create a class Multiplier with an __init__() to set a factor. Define a __call__() method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with callable() and by calling the object like a function.

class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, number):
        return number * self.factor

m = Multiplier(5)

print(callable(m))  


result = m(10)  
print(result)
